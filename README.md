## Description

The repository includes `FS_QM_model_with_HFS.m` and `FS_QM_model_without_HFS.m`. The spin flip probability measured in the [Frisch-Segre experiment](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01335699) is modeled using standard quantum mechanics. Details of the study can be found [here]().

The Matlab codes generate a new directory containing the outputs:
1. A copy of the script executed

2. The workspace at the end of the code
     
3. Two plots corresponding to the time-traces of the spins and the spin flip probabilities versus the wire current
