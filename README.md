## Description

The repository includes `FS_QM_model_with_HFS.m`, `FS_QM_model_without_HFS.m` and `FS_QM_model.jl`. The spin flip probability measured in the [Frisch-Segre experiment](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01335699) is modeled using standard quantum mechanics. Details of the study can be found [here]().
